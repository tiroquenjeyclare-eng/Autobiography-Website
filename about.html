     Every story begins somewhere. Mine began on July 1, 2007, at Mactan Doctors Hospital in Lapu-Lapu City. My name is Quenjey Clare T. Tiro, and I’m 18 years old. I’m currently a first-year college student taking up a Bachelor of Industrial Technology, a path I never expected to walk on. As a child, I dreamed of flying. Not just in the imaginative sense, but of being inside those large airplanes that carry people across the world. I was fascinated by the idea of traveling, of moving above the clouds. But life has a quiet way of guiding us toward unexpected destinations. Who would’ve thought that my curiosity about how technology works would lead me here, to a course that challenges me to build, understand, and create.

     I am the second and youngest child of my parents, Enrique Tiro and Jeanisa Tiro. I share my childhood with my older brother, Clydesdale Josh Tiro. Growing up, my life wasn’t always as lively or adventurous as others might describe theirs. I had good days, playing outside with my cousins until we were called home with gentle scoldings. We used to wander anywhere with my aunt, all of us cousins together, exploring and finding little adventures to do. We would always go out walking, and my mom trusted my aunt so much that she always allowed us to join. I could say that those memories are one of the highlights of my childhood. But as I grew older, I found comfort in solitude. I preferred staying indoors, enjoying my own company. I rarely take pictures, even during special occasions, and I often feel shy and awkward around people. In short, I became an introvert. I kept my circle small, and I liked to exist quietly and subtly in this world.

    In high school, I found my people who understand my silent days, when I prefer not to talk much. It’s not because I don’t want to, but simply because I enjoy the quiet. They are the ones I feel comfortable and happy to be with. I also got to experience so many things because of them, even spontaneous moments that I didn’t think I’d enjoy but surprisingly, I did. Yet being introverted and reserved didn’t hinder me from achieving something and what I mean about achieving something is I am a consistent honor student. I may exist subtly, but I strive with purpose. This quiet existence has also taught me many things. Through my journey, I’ve learned to step out of my shell, to socialize, and to seek improvement, not just academically, but personally. Senior high school opened my doors to new experiences, new people, and new ways of thinking. It helped me grow into someone who can balance solitude with connection.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    But this is only the beginning of my story, and wherever life takes me next, I’ll keep building, keep learning, and keep showing up, maybe softly, but surely.
